                                <p><strong>Outsourced data processing</strong></p>
                                <p>We have entered into an agreement with Google for the outsourcing of our data processing and fully implement the strict requirements of the Hungarian data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.</p>
                                <h4 class="fw-bold">5. Newsletter</h2>
                                <p><strong>Newsletter data</strong></p>
                                <p>If you would like to receive our newsletter, we require a valid email address as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and that you agree to receive this newsletter. No additional data is collected or is only collected on a voluntary basis. We only use this data to send the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>
                                <p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g. through the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
                                <p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remain unaffected.</p>
                                <p><strong>inxmail</strong></p>
                                <p>Our email newsletters are sent via the technical service provider Inxmail GmbH, Wentzigerstr. 17, 79106 Freiburg, Germany, Tel.: +49 761 296979-0, Email: <a href="#">info@inxmail.de</a>, <a href="#">https://www.inxmail.de</a>, to whom we pass on the data you provided when registering for the newsletter.</p>
                                <p>This forwarding takes place within the scope of order processing by Inxmail. Please note that your data is usually transferred to a server of Inxmail and stored there.</p>
                                <p>Inxmail uses this information to send and statistically evaluate the newsletters on our behalf. For the evaluation, the emails sent contain so-called web beacons or tracking pixels, which are single-pixel image files stored on our website.</p>
                                <p>This makes it possible to determine whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links, if any, have been clicked on. Technical information is also recorded (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type and operating system). The data is collected only in a pseudonymous form and is not linked to your other personal data; a direct personal reference is excluded.</p>
                                <p>This data is used only for the statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients. If you wish to object to the data analysis for statistical evaluation purposes, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter.</p>
                                <p>You can revoke the consent you have given at any time. You can also prevent the processing at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. You can also prevent the storage of cookies by setting your web browser accordingly. You can also prevent the storage and transmission of personal data by deactivating JavaScript in your web browser or installing a JavaScript blocker (e.g. <a href="#">https://noscript.net</a> or <a href="#">https://www.ghostery.com</a>). We would like to point out that these measures may mean that not all functions of our website are available.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore, Inxmail may use this data itself in accordance with Art. 6 (1) f) DSGVO on the basis of its own legitimate interest in designing and optimizing the service in line with demand, as well as for market research purposes, for example to determine which countries the recipients come from. However, Inxmail does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write to them itself or to pass it on to third parties.</p>

                                <p><strong>Newsletter tracking</strong></p>
                                <p>Our newsletters contain so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded in such emails that are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and log file analysis. This enables statistical evaluation of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, the company can see if and when an e-mail was opened by you and which links in the e-mail were called up by you.</p>
                                <p>Such personal data collected via the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and evaluated by us to optimize the newsletter dispatch and to better adapt the content of future newsletters to your interests. This personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Data subjects are entitled at any time to revoke the separate declaration of consent given in this regard via the double opt-in procedure. After a revocation, this personal data will be deleted by us. We automatically interpret an unsubscription from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.</p>
                                <p>Such an evaluation is carried out, in particular, in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) DSGVO on the basis of our legitimate interests in the insertion of personalized advertising, market research, and/or needs-based design of our website.</p>

                                <p><strong>Legal basis for data processing:</strong></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal basis for the data processing and for the transfer of the data to the above-mentioned third parties is Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. b DSGVO. In addition, Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. f DSGVO is the legal basis for data processing.</span></p>
                                <p><strong>Purpose of data processing:</strong></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transmission of the data and the processing of the same is necessary to carry out the payment of the transaction made by you on our Shopportal in Hungary with the payment method selected by you and thus to be able to complete the transaction. The connection of many different payment methods is complex and cost-intensive. Therefore, we use a service provider for the technical connection, in which our legitimate interest in the above data processing by GiroSolution Hungary Kft is justified according to Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. f DSGVO.</span></p>
                                <p><strong>Duration of storage:</strong></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. In the case of the above-mentioned data, this is the case when the contract has been settled and there are no longer any claims for return, i.e. after expiry of the statutory warranty or guarantee periods granted. Subject to legal retention periods beyond this point, the data will then be deleted.</span></p>
                                <p><strong>Possibility of objection and removal:</strong></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is absolutely necessary for the operation of the website. Consequently, there is no possibility of objection on the part of the user.</span></p>
                                <p><strong>PayPal</strong></p>
