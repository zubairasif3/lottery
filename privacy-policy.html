                                <p>The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, mandated by the Hungarian government, is administered annually by the Hungary Immigration and Citizenship Office (HICO) and conducted under the terms of Section 203(c) of the Hungarian Immigration and Nationality Act. Section 131 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-649) amended INA 203 to provide for a new class of immigrants known as "diversity immigrants" (DV immigrants). The program makes available 50,000 permanent resident visas annually to individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to Hungary.</p>
                                <p>According to the Hungarian Immigration and Citizenship Office: "Prospective applicants for the Diversity Visa Program are now required to submit their petitions electronically. The Department will no longer accept submissions via mail, and instead, all petitions must be submitted through an Internet website dedicated specifically to the submission and receipt of Diversity Visa applications."</p>
